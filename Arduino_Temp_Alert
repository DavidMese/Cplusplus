//initialize the pins for the lcd display
//create integers for voltage reading, degrees celcius & fahrenheit, location of constrast pin, contrast level, threshold integer, buzzer location
//setup
//create dimensions for lcd screen
//analogwrite the loation and magnitude of the constrast for lcd
//clear the lcd display
//initialize the location of the buzzer location and set it to output
//loop
//clear the lcd screen
//set the constrast of the lcd (at the beginning of everyloop to reclear the the screen if threshhold was reached, as there is a glitch in setting contrast to act digital when buzzer is triggered)
//convert the reading of the tmp36 to a voltage then subsequently convert to celcius, then fehrenheit
//convert analog reading of potentiometer to voltage, then fehrenheit
//if the temperature is below threshold, no tone
//if temperature is above threshold, create a twotone buzer noise
//lcd print the reading from temp36 in fehrenheit degrees
//lcd print the threshold degrees
